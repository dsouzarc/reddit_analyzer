### Useful analytics that I want

Analyzes Reddit for useful statistics that I would like to know.

Examples include the prime time to post based on the number of users online

- Involves tracking the ratio of users online to total subscribers over time 

- Getting the posts from those times and seeing the number of upvotes they get

- Looking for correlation between time, number of posts at that time and their popularity
